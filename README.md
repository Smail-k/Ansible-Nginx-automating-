# deploying applications with ansible 
before playing this project you should add a file of hosts where you want to apply this project 
and also add your SSH Key to those hosts
or you can check my script shell for installing ansible and adding SSH key 

# after adding hosts file
you can play now the playbook by :
ansible-playbook -i "the path of your host file" playbook.yml 
hope that help you
